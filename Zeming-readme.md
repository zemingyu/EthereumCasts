This is based on https://github.com/StephenGrider/EthereumCasts

The goal is to build on top of the existing projects, and add new features. 

E.g.
1. Spend ERC20 tokens rather than ETH
2. With the Lottery project, set up the probability of winning the lottery based on contribution amount, rather than number of times entered into the game

Status Update
20180304 - Can't figure out how to spend the ERC20 token (ACTUARY token) Now stuck
